### Overview and Objectives

**Problem Statement**
The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) has collected data on Challenger Tour and Pro Tour players information since 1968. Though the data has help players individually on their training and tactics, the data remained underutilized. This has been made evident by the lack of diversity, the ATP Pro Tour has been dominated by the same group of people. A new strategy is needed to get athletes to compete at the Pro Tour level.

**Executive Summary**
This project focused on data science methods while identifying possible solutions of immediate impact. We identify players result at Challengers level could predict players participations in the Pro Tour. We also identify the participation level of Challenger Tour and the Pro Tour particular concerning.

**Data Dictionary**

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
During the EDA process we encountered our main problem, the data is formatted based on each match played with winning player’s and losing player’s name. We need to extract the data and format them so that we can have players name and all the tournament/matches the player has won or lost. It was also apparent that the players in the ATP Tour dataset are significantly smaller than the players in the Challenger Tour
Our primary objective was to check for disparity between Challenger Tour and Pro, and create a predictive model to verify if results in Challenger Tour would translate to Pro Tour.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

We first recognized that the players who participates in the Challenger Tour and their results could help predict the players participation in the Pro Tour. We also identify the concern regarding low player participation in Pro Tour compare to Challenger Tour. 
However, we were able to identify key elements, such as players finance and tour invitations may be a major factor. There were many chances given to players in the Challenger Tour to participate in the Pro Tour. And most importantly their finance. As players in Challenger Tour does not receive sponsorship, it’s up to the players to found themselves. That include training, accommodation, and travel. Therefore, Challenger level players may only be able to participate in their local Challenger events.
There are a few things that can be done by the ATP to help Challenger level players. ATP can provide training facility and tournament accommodations to reduce financial burden, and also award more prize money for participation.
